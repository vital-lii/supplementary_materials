# Supplementary Materials for Remimazolam Meta-Analysis

This repository contains supplementary materials for the systematic review and meta-analysis titled "Multidimensional Clinical Evaluation of Remimazolam versus Propofol and Dexmedetomidine: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Based on Differentiated Endpoints".

## Repository Contents

### Data Files
- `R_P_dataset.xlsx` - Extracted and processed data for Remimazolam vs. Propofol comparison
- `R_VS_D_DATA.xlsx` - Extracted and processed data for Remimazolam vs. Dexmedetomidine comparison
### Note on Data Files

The data extraction tables (`R_P_dataset.xlsx` and `R_VS_D_DATA.xlsx`) contain both Chinese and English text, reflecting the original extraction process and maintaining data integrity. Some considerations:

- **Multilingual Content**: Data files contain Chinese characters in certain fields, particularly in notes and study characteristics, reflecting the original research documentation process
- **Original Format Preserved**: We have maintained the original extraction format to ensure transparency in our research process
- **Data Structure**: While the files may appear less structured than processed data, this represents the actual working files used in our analysis, providing full transparency of our methodology
 
### Documentation
- `search_strategy.docx` - Detailed documentation of the literature search methodology

## Data Extraction Methodology

The data extraction tables include information from randomized controlled trials comparing Remimazolam with Propofol and Dexmedetomidine. For each included study, we extracted:

- Study characteristics (author, year, country)
- Patient demographics (sample size, age, ASA status)
- Intervention details (drug dosing, administration protocols)
- Outcome measures including efficacy and safety endpoints

## Analysis Code

The meta-regression analysis code is available in a separate repository:
